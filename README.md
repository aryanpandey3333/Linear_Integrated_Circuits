# Linear_Integrated_Circuits
This repository contains my lab files for Linear Integrated Circuits (LIC). These circuits are electronic circuits that integrate multiple analog functions, such as amplifiers, filters, and oscillators, into a single chip. The files include circuit diagrams, schematics, and simulation results.
