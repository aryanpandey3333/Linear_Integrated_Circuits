# Linear_Integrated_Circuits
This repository contains my lab files for Linear Integrated Circuits (LIC). These circuits are electronic circuits that integrate multiple analog functions, such as amplifiers, filters, and oscillators, into a single chip. The files include circuit diagrams, schematics, and simulation results.

Each lab file corresponds to a specific LIC circuit and includes a description of the circuit's function, design, and analysis. The files are organized by lab session and cover a range of topics, including operational amplifiers, voltage regulators, and phase-locked loops.

Overall, these lab files provide a comprehensive introduction to LIC and demonstrate their use in practical applications. They are suitable for students and hobbyists interested in analog electronics and circuit design.

For usinf these circuits files you need to have LT SPICE
If you dont have it then please download it or you can use this link: - https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html
